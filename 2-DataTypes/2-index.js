// There are 8 basic data types in JavaScript.

// Seven primitive data types:

// number for numbers of any kind: integer or floating-point, integers are limited by ±(253-1).

// bigint for integer numbers of arbitrary length.

// string for strings. A string may have zero or more characters, there’s no separate single-character type.

// boolean for true/false.

// null for unknown values – a standalone type that has a single value null. 
// This behavior is a known issue and is not indicative of null being an actual object. It's a mistake in the language's implementation. In reality, null is a primitive value, and its type should be "null."

// undefined for unassigned values – a standalone type that has a single value undefined.

// symbol for unique identifiers.

// And one non-primitive data type:
// object for more complex data structures.
